# My understanding of DevOps
DevOps is a culture that brings teams together to build, test, and deploy high-quality software faster.
It breaks down silos, enabling developers, operations managers, QAs, and testers to communicate effectively.
Through continuous integration and continuous delivery powered by pipelines and automation, DevOps delivers reliable, secure, and high-performing software.

# Why learning Devops and Cloud
I have always been fascinated by technology, so when I set out to start my career, I explored different paths—and DevOps immediately caught my interest. I love how it involves us in every stage, from staging to deployment. We design and build the entire pipeline from start to finish, and then—boom—the software is deployed. And of course, it pays...
